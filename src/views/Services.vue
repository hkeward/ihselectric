        <h4>New Installations</h4>
        <p>
          For residential and commercial clients, much of our work revolves
          around new installations, whether it's washers and dryers for the home
          or a piece of industrial equipment for a factory. Regardless of what's
          being installed or where we know how to evaluate its power needs and
          make sure the installation is done correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason why it's a good idea to leave new installations to the
          professionals at IHS Electric is that an improper installation can
          lead to many different problems, ranging from excessive energy
          consumption or appliance failure to an overloaded circuit that can
          create a dangerous situation. With us, you can be sure that your
          electrical system is safe and that your investment is protected.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of our new electrical installations come with the signature IHS
          Electric quality. For the work at hand, we'll always use the highest
          grade of materials available, and from our suppliers, you’re sure to
          get a great price.
        </p>
        <p>
          IHS Electric is a Stratford name you can trust for new installations.

          good chance that your property needs a professional electrical
          inspection. Affordable and detail-oriented, IHS Electric can provide

          While much of our inspection and troubleshooting work involves finding
          a solution for redundant wiring or overloaded circuits, IHS Electric
          is also available for routine inspections related to commercial
          safety, home maintenance, rental units, and property sales. A clean
          bill of health from an electrical contractor ensures that your
          property's safety and value are always kept at their utmost potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Local businesses are often required to have electrical inspections on
          a regular basis by a third party. We currently provide this service to

          compliance with electrical regulations.
